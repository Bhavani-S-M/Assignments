1. Configure smtp in localhost.
Ans:
	Step 1 : Install postfix
		sudo apt install postfix
			##Directly We cann't able to install smpt in linux that's why we have to install softwares like postfix which implements the smtp protocol.
			
	Step 2 : Install mailutils
		sudo apt install mailutils
		
	Step 3 : Now we can send the mail to localhost users
		echo "This is the first message" | mail -s "Test subject" testuser
			
2.Create a user in your localhost, which should not be able to execute the sudo command.
Ans:
	Step 1 : Command to create a user without sudo privileges:
			sudo adduser testuser
			
	Step 2 : Command to check whether user have sudo privileges or not:
			sudo -l
				# It directly says whether the user can able to run sudo commands or not
	
3. Configure your system in such a way that when a user type and executes a describe command from anywhere of the system it must list all the file and folders of the user's current directory.
Ans:
	Step 1 : Create a script in /usr/local/bin path and give file name as describe:
		sudo nano /usr/local/bin/describe
		
	Step 2 : Add below code for that file:
		#!/bin/bash
		ls 
	
	Step 3 : Make that describe as executable:
		sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/describe
	
	Now user can run the command describe form any where.
	
4.Users can put a compressed file at any path of the linux file system. The name of the file will be research and the extension will be of compression type, example for gzip type extension will be .gz. You have to fine the file and check the compression type and uncompress it:
Ans:
	Step 1: Compressing a file
			gzip -c /home/sigmoid/research > /home/sigmoid/temp/research.gz
				## This command will compress the research file and stores it into temp directory
				
	Step 2: Checking that if compressed is file is there or not
			ls -l
			  or
			find -type f -name "reseach.*"
				## From using this command we can find reseach.gz file
				
	Step 3: Uncompressing the file
			gunzip -c /home/sigmoid/temp/research.gz > /home/sigmoid/research
				## This command will extract the file and stores in sigmoid's home directory
				
				
5. Configure your system in such a way that any user of your system creates a file then there should not be permission to do any activity in that file. Note: Don't use the chmod command.
Ans:
	Removing permissions for all users.
	Step 1: Goto etc/profile file and add umask 077 line
		command - sudo nano /etc/profile
			## Add umask 077 at the end of the line and save that file
	
	Step 2: create a new file in anywhere and permission
		touch testfile | ls -ltr
			## Now we can see that file is created and it contains only user permissions it doesnot have group or other permissions.
			
6. Create a service with the name showtime, after starting the service, every minute it should print the current time in a file in the user home directory.
Ans: 
	Step 1: First we have to create script in /usr/local/bin/ folder:
		sudo nano /usr/local/bin/showtime.sh
		
	Step 2: Add the following lines to the script:
		#!/bin/bash
		while true; do
  			echo "Current time: $(date)" >> /home/$USER/showtime.log
  			sleep 60
		done

	Step 3: Change the permission of that file and make as executable
		sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/showtime.sh
		
	Step 4: Then create service of showtime
		sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/showtime.service
		
	Step 5: Add the following lines to that file:
		GNU nano 7.2                /etc/systemd/system/showtime.service                         
		[Unit]
		Description=Show current time every minute
		After=network.target

		[Service]
		ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/showtime.sh
		Restart=always
		User=sigmoid

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target
		
	Step 6: Enable the services by running following commands one by one:
		sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
		sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		sudo systemctl enable showtime
		
	Step 7: Start the service by running following commands:
		sudo systemctl start showtime	#it will start writing in file
		sudo systemctl stop showtime	#it will stop writing to file
		sudo systemctl status showtime	#it shows status
		
	If we want to see the output of that file we can use the following command
	cat showtime.log
